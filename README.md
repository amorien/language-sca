[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caleb531/language-sca.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caleb531/language-sca)

Adds syntax highlighting to NetSuite's SuiteCommerce Advanced files in Atom.

This package requires that Atom's built-in `language-mustache`, `language-html`,
and `language-javascript` packages be enabled for syntax highlighting to work
properly, so please make sure they are.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
