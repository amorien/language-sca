Adds syntax highlighting to NetSuite's SuiteCommerce Advanced files in Atom.
Currently, only `.ssp` files are highlighted, but other file types (like `.tpl`)
are under consideration.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
